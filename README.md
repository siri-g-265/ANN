# ANN
The choice of Activation Functions (AF) has proven to be an important factor that affects the performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This report aims to use a 1-hidden layer neural network model that adapts to the most suitable activation function according to the data set. The ANN model can learn for itself the best AF to use by exploiting a flexible functional form, k0 + k1 âˆ— x with parameters k0, k1 being learned from multiple runs.
